# Hotel_webscrape

## Problem
A client wanted to carry out analysis on several hotel prices before goin into the business. Unfortunately, the data needed to carry out the analysis was not readily accesible.

## Solution
Leveraging the beautiful soup package, I was able to webscrape a hotel booking site and get the required data for analysis

## Improvement
BUild a pipeline for continous data ingestion and analysis
